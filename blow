# An experimental "Battery Low for i3" warning script written in pure bash.
# This script is actually created mostly for WM users.
# As we know that most WMs do not warn us on low battery levels and this
# causes a lot of problems sometimes. This also works on tty terminals without X
# if you use ssh or something. I hope this script will help you to solve those
# problems :)

# you can customize things at VARIABLES section. Set your personal
# wave, mp3 file to play when your battery decreases to $CURRENT_BATTERY_VALUE
# you can also use commands like i3-nagbar instead of ringing a sound or even espeak :D
# If you want to find more sounds go to https://freesound.org
# make it run at startup and enjoy! don't let your data being lost :)
